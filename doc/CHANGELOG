ergatis-v2r1b1
---------------
**Major restructuring of architecture for simplification and added scalability**
Highlights
-Support for multiple iterators and iterator names (example default name: i1)
-New script create_iterator_groups to batch input sets and includes a max batch size setting to limit batch sizes and automatically create add'l batches as needed. This provides add'l scalability by limiting the size of an individual group XML file.
-Removal of workflow INI from all components and pipeline steps. Reduces number of files maintained per component and simplifies generation of component and pipeline XML.Components and pipelines now fully descripted in workflow XML
-No longer using workflow iterators in order to reduce nesting of workflow XML and avoid "shell"XML files 
-RunUnixCommand is now an alias for RunJavaUnixCommand. Commands are forked from within Java w/o workflow adding an add'l perl wrapper
-RunUnixCommands now use <executable> tag instead of <param>command</param>
-Renamed ergatis conf file
Eg. waitconf.ini -> wait.config
-Renamed master template
Eg. wait-master_template.xml -> wait.xml
-Renamed iterator template
Eg. wait_temlate.xml -> wait.i1.xml
wait-master_template.xml -> wait.xml
-Cleanup of deprecated files in workflow/shared (batch*.xml/ini,default*.xml/ini)
-Move all perl/shell scripts from workflow/ to src/perl
-New script replace_template_keys is used to replace config keys in template XML and build iterated subflows
-changed conf file headings to remove component name. The component name was unnecessary and complicates parsing
[input wait] --> [input]
[output wait] --> [output]
-Deprecated scripts generate_subflow,run_pipeline,generate_groups,generate_input_list

** other changes **
