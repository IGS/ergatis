<p>
    I'm just throwing some notes here to get an idea of the sort of documents I want to be
    available.  The only one that is currently available is the component documentation.  Later
    versions of this page will probably not look much like this.

<dl>
    <dt><a>overview</a></dt>

        Not yet available. 
    </dd>
    <dt><a href='http://jorvis-lx:8080/egc.components.html'>component documentation</a></dt>
    <dd>
        Here you'll find the documentation for each of the workflow components available within
        ergatis, along with the progess notes of those under development.  This currently links
        to an external file which should soon be reformatted and incorporated within the ergatis
        CVS area.

        workflow component for ergatis.

    <dt><a>pipeline creation tutorial</a></dt>
